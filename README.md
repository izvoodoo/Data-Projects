Data Projects

This is my data project concerning the ratio of contracted nurses to employee nurses in retirement communities as well as the nursing minutes per resident in each City and State as well as the providers there in. 

The initial data can be found through this link:

The file is too large for GitHub.

I've attached the endpoint Tableau workbook.  I also created a seperate workbook in Power BI but I will have to attach that as a PDF as power bi cannot be shared without a license.

The goal of this project was to find what cities had high minutes per nursing (where it is good to retire) and where had low (Kansas City is... rough).

Mesa, AZ (a popular retirement area) had by far the highest nursing per resident minutes.  Seattl came in second. 

I have worked in retirement and always have been interested in the Economics of aging and how much financial demand the Golden Years can cost. 

This project was a mock up for a nursing contracting firm.  Were I hired by one I could tell them the following:
What cities had low minutes per nursing (i.e. areas that may be understaffed) and areas with high minutes per resident (areas where demand may be high). 

I can also tell a contracting firm the percentage at which each Provider in each city hires contracted nurses. 

I used Python (Pandas library), SQL (SQL Server Management Studio), Tableau and Power BI to complete this project.
